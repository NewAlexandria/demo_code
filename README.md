# A Directory of Pseudo-Demos

Some of the code here was written explicitly to be a demo.  Others are scrapple from various projects.  Each can give you some sense of code and style, but ultimate these fall short of the proprietary work done.

I encourage the reader to also look across the range of repos and community involvement I have.
